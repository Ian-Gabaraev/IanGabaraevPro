## AWS Global Infrastructure

### Regions

A **Region** is a geographic area with multiple data centers (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-2`).

| Consideration | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Compliance** | Data may need to stay in specific countries |
| **Latency** | Deploy closer to users for better performance |
| **Service availability** | Not all services available in all regions |
| **Pricing** | Varies by region |

### Availability Zones (AZs)

Each Region has **2-6 AZs** (e.g., `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`). Each AZ = one or more discrete data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity.

| Key Point | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Isolation** | AZs are physically separated (disaster protection) |
| **Low latency** | Connected via high-bandwidth, low-latency networking |
| **HA design** | Distribute resources across AZs for fault tolerance |

### Edge Locations & Global Services

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Edge Locations** | CDN endpoints for CloudFront (200+ worldwide) |
| **Global services** | IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, WAF (not region-specific) |
| **Regional services** | EC2, RDS, EBS, etc. (bound to a region) |

> 💡 **Exam tip:** Know which services are global vs regional. IAM is global; EC2 and EBS are regional; EBS is AZ-specific.

---

## IAM (Identity & Access Management)

> **Global service** — not region-specific

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Users** | Individual identities, can belong to multiple groups |
| **Groups** | Collections of users (cannot nest groups) |
| **Policies** | JSON documents defining permissions |
| **Inline Policy** | Policy attached directly to a user (no group needed) |

### Policy Structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",    // Policy language version
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "StatementId",     // Optional identifier
    "Effect": "Allow|Deny",
    "Principal": "arn:...",   // Account/user/role this applies to
    "Action": ["s3:Get*"],    // API actions
    "Resource": ["arn:..."]   // Target resources
  }]
}
```

### Roles

- Permissions for **services**, not users
- Attach policies to roles → assign roles to services (e.g., EC2)
- The service receiving the role = **trusted entity**

### Security Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Credentials Report** | CSV of all users + credential status |
| **Access Advisor** | Shows service access history per user |

---

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

**EC2 encompasses:** Instances • EBS (drives) • ELB (load balancing) • ASG (auto-scaling)

### Configuration Options

- **OS:** Linux, Windows, MacOS
- **Compute:** CPU cores, RAM
- **Storage:** Network (EBS/EFS) or Hardware (Instance Store)
- **Network:** Card speed, public/private IP

**User Data** — Bootstrap script that runs at launch with root privileges. Use for updates, software installation, config.

---

### Security Groups

Acts as a **firewall** for EC2 instances.

| Rule Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Inbound** | Blocked | Controls incoming traffic |
| **Outbound** | Allowed | Controls outgoing traffic |

> ⚠️ **Timeout = Security Group issue** — If you can't connect (SSH/HTTP/HTTPS), check SG first

**Key points:**

- Locked to **region + VPC**
- SGs can reference other SGs (e.g., allow traffic from instances with SG2)

### Common Ports

| Port | Protocol |
|------|----------|
| 22 | SSH / SFTP |
| 21 | FTP |
| 80 | HTTP |
| 443 | HTTPS |
| 3389 | RDP (Windows) |

---

### Instance Types

**Naming:** `m5.2xlarge` → **m** (class) + **5** (generation) + **2xlarge** (size)

| Type | Prefix | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **General Purpose** | t3, m5 | Balanced workloads |
| **Compute Optimized** | c5 | Batch processing, high-performance computing |
| **Memory Optimized** | r5 | In-memory databases, caching |
| **Storage Optimized** | i3 | High IOPS, data warehousing |
| **GPU** | p3 | ML/AI, graphics |
| **FPGA** | f1 | Custom hardware acceleration |

### Purchasing Options

| Option | Discount | Commitment | Best For |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| **On-Demand** | None | None | Short, unpredictable workloads |
| **Reserved** | Up to 72% | 1-3 years | Steady-state workloads |
| **Savings Plan** | Up to 72% | $/hour for 1-3 years | Flexible long workloads |
| **Spot** | Up to 90% | None (can be interrupted) | Batch jobs, fault-tolerant |
| **Dedicated Host** | Varies | Optional 1-3 year | Licensing, compliance |
| **Dedicated Instance** | Varies | None | Compliance, isolation |
| **Capacity Reservation** | None | Pay regardless of use | Guaranteed availability |

**On-Demand:** Linux/Windows billed per second (after 1st min), other OS per hour

**Reserved Instances:** Reserve specific attributes (type, region, OS). Pay upfront = more discount. Can sell on AWS Marketplace.

**Savings Plan:** Commit to $/hour spend, locked to instance family + region (e.g., m5 in us-east-1). Excess usage = On-Demand pricing.

**Spot:** Cheapest option. Lose instance when spot price > your bid. Never use for critical workloads.

**Dedicated Host vs Instance:**

- **Host** — Full server control, see sockets/cores (for BYOL licensing)
- **Instance** — Dedicated hardware, no host visibility, may share with same account

---

## AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

> **Region-specific** — must copy to use in another region

AMI = Pre-configured EC2 template (OS + software + config)

| AMI Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Public** | AWS-provided (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.) |
| **AWS Marketplace** | Third-party, often pre-configured software |
| **Custom** | Your own, built from an EC2 instance |

**Creating a Custom AMI:**

1. Launch EC2 → configure/install software
2. Stop instance (for data integrity)
3. Create AMI → creates EBS snapshots automatically
4. Launch new instances from your AMI

> 💡 AMIs speed up boot time since software is pre-baked, not installed via User Data

---

## EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Network-attached storage for EC2 — like a USB stick over the network.

**Key characteristics:**

- Bound to **one AZ**
- Attached to **one instance** at a time (except io1/io2 Multi-Attach)
- Network drive = some latency
- Persists independently of instance lifecycle

### EBS Snapshots

Backup mechanism for EBS volumes — can restore to any AZ.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cross-AZ restore** | Snapshot in us-east-1a → restore in us-east-1b |
| **Recycle Bin** | Deleted snapshots recoverable (configurable retention) |
| **Fast Snapshot Restore** | No latency on first use, but expensive |

### EC2 Instance Store

Hardware-attached storage (physically on the host) — **not network-based**.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Extremely high IOPS (millions) | **Ephemeral** — data lost on stop/terminate/hardware failure |
| Low latency (direct attached) | Cannot detach and reattach |
| Included in instance cost | Size tied to instance type |

**Use cases:** Buffer, cache, scratch data, temporary content

> ⚠️ **You are responsible for backups/replication** — AWS won't recover this data

### Delete on Termination

| Volume | Default Behavior |
|--------|------------------|
| Root EBS | **Deleted** on termination |
| Additional EBS | **Preserved** on termination |

Can be changed via console or CLI at launch time.

---

### EBS Volume Types

| Type | Category | IOPS | Throughput | Size | Boot? |
|------|----------|------|------------|------|-------|
| **gp3** | General SSD | 3,000–16,000 | 125–1,000 MiB/s | 1 GiB–16 TiB | ✅ |
| **gp2** | General SSD | 3 IOPS/GiB (max 16,000) | Linked to IOPS | 1 GiB–16 TiB | ✅ |
| **io2 Block Express** | Provisioned IOPS | Up to 256,000 | 4,000 MiB/s | 4 GiB–64 TiB | ✅ |
| **io1** | Provisioned IOPS | Up to 64,000 | 1,000 MiB/s | 4 GiB–16 TiB | ✅ |
| **st1** | Throughput HDD | Max 500 | 500 MiB/s | 125 GiB–16 TiB | ❌ |
| **sc1** | Cold HDD | Max 250 | 250 MiB/s | 125 GiB–16 TiB | ❌ |

> 💡 **Only SSD types (gp2/gp3/io1/io2) can be boot volumes**

**gp3 vs gp2:** gp3 allows independent IOPS/throughput scaling; gp2 links IOPS to size

**Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2):** For sustained IOPS needs — databases, critical apps. io2 Block Express offers sub-millisecond latency.

### EBS Multi-Attach

- **io1/io2 only** — attach same volume to multiple EC2 in same AZ
- Up to **16 instances** simultaneously
- Use case: clustered applications requiring shared storage

---

## EFS (Elastic File System)

Managed NFS that can be mounted on **multiple EC2 across multiple AZs**.

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Compatibility** | Linux only (POSIX) |
| **Scaling** | Automatic, up to petabytes |
| **Throughput** | Up to 10+ GB/s |
| **Pricing** | Pay per GB used |

### Performance Modes

| Mode | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **General Purpose** | Latency-sensitive (web servers, CMS) |
| **Max I/O** | Higher latency, highly parallel (big data) |

### Throughput Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Bursting** | Scales with storage size |
| **Provisioned** | Fixed throughput regardless of size |
| **Elastic** | Auto-scales based on workload (recommended) |

### Storage Tiers

| Tier | Cost | Access |
|------|------|--------|
| **Standard** | Higher | Frequent |
| **Infrequent Access (IA)** | Lower storage, pay per retrieval | Occasional |
| **Archive** | ~50% cheaper | Rare |

> 💡 Use **lifecycle policies** to auto-move files between tiers

### Availability

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Standard (Multi-AZ)** | Production, HA |
| **One Zone** | Dev/backup, cheaper, single AZ |

---

## EBS vs EFS vs Instance Store

| Feature | EBS | EFS | Instance Store |
|---------|-----|-----|----------------|
| **Attach to** | 1 instance (io1/io2: multi) | 100s of instances | 1 instance |
| **AZ scope** | Single AZ | Multi-AZ | Single AZ |
| **Persistence** | Persists | Persists | Ephemeral |
| **Use case** | Boot volumes, databases | Shared content, web serving | Cache, temp data |
| **Cost** | Per provisioned GB | Per used GB | Included |

## ELB & ASG (Load Balancing & Auto Scaling)

> **Terminology:** ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) is the **service name**, not a load balancer type. The actual LB types are ALB, NLB, GLB, and CLB.

### OSI Model Quick Reference

| Layer | Name | Protocol/Example | AWS LB |
|-------|------|------------------|--------|
| 7 | Application | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket | ALB |
| 4 | Transport | TCP, UDP, TLS | NLB |
| 3 | Network | IP, ICMP | GLB |
| 2 | Data Link | Ethernet, MAC | — |
| 1 | Physical | Cables, signals | — |

---

### Load Balancer Types

| Type | Layer | Protocols | Use Case |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **ALB** | 7 | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket | Web apps, microservices |
| **NLB** | 4 | TCP, UDP, TLS | Extreme performance, static IP |
| **GLB** | 3 | IP (GENEVE) | Firewalls, packet inspection |
| **CLB** | 4/7 | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL | Legacy (avoid) |

> ⚠️ **CLB** = Classic Load Balancer, sometimes called "Classic ELB" — adds to the ELB naming confusion. Avoid for new projects.

---

### ELB Health Checks

LB periodically pings targets to verify they're healthy.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Protocol** | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP |
| **Path** | e.g., `/health` (HTTP/HTTPS only) |
| **Interval** | Time between checks (default: 30s) |
| **Threshold** | Consecutive successes/failures to change state |
| **Timeout** | Time to wait for response |

> ⚠️ **ELB does NOT terminate unhealthy targets** — it only stops routing traffic to them

### ASG + ELB Health Checks

ASG can use ELB health status to decide when to terminate/replace instances.

| Health Check Type | Default | Termination Trigger |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------|
| **EC2** | ✅ Yes | Instance stopped, impaired, or terminated |
| **ELB** | ❌ No | Target fails LB health check |

> 💡 Enable ELB health checks on ASG for automatic replacement of app-level failures

---

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Layer 7 (HTTP) — routes to **target groups**:

| Target Type | Example |
|-------------|--------|
| EC2 instances | i-0123... |
| Lambda functions | my-function |
| Private IPs | On-prem servers |

**Routing rules based on:**

- URL path (`/api/*`, `/images/*`)
- Hostname (`api.example.com`)
- Query strings (`?platform=mobile`)
- HTTP headers

**Key points:**

- Fixed DNS hostname (no static IP)
- Client IP in `X-Forwarded-For` header
- WebSocket support

---

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) — **highest performance** LB.

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Performance | Millions of requests/sec |
| Latency | ~100ms (vs ~400ms ALB) |
| Static IP | One per AZ |

**Target groups:** EC2 instances, Private IPs, ALB (NLB → ALB combo)

**NLB provides:**

- Static hostname
- Static IP (one per AZ)
- Elastic IP support

> 💡 **When to use NLB:** Gaming servers, IoT backends, financial trading platforms — anywhere you need ultra-low latency, millions of requests/sec, or must whitelist a static IP for clients/firewalls.

### ALB vs NLB Routing

| Routing By | ALB | NLB |
|------------|-----|-----|
| URL path | ✅ | ❌ |
| Hostname | ✅ | ❌ |
| Query strings | ✅ | ❌ |
| HTTP headers | ✅ | ❌ |
| Port | ✅ | ✅ |

> NLB = Layer 4 (sees packets, not HTTP). ALB = Layer 7 (sees HTTP content). **Content-based routing → ALB. Static IP + performance → NLB.**

---

### Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)

Layer 3 (IP) — for **network appliances** (firewalls, IDS, packet inspection).

**Flow:** Traffic → GLB → Security appliances → GLB → Your app

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Protocol | GENEVE (port 6081) |
| Use case | Third-party virtual appliances |
| Layer | 3 (Network) |

> GENEVE encapsulates packets in UDP for cross-host VM/container communication

---

### Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

Same client always routed to same target instance.

| Cookie Type | Who Creates | Cookie Name |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Duration-based** | ALB | `AWSALB` (reserved) |
| **Application-based (LB)** | ALB | `AWSALBAPP` (reserved) |
| **Application-based (App)** | Your app | Custom (e.g., `SESSIONID`) |

> ⚠️ `AWSALB*` names are **AWS-reserved** — cannot be used by your app

> 💡 Use for stateful apps; avoid if possible (prefer stateless + external session store)

---

### Cross-Zone Load Balancing

Distributes traffic evenly across all targets in all AZs, regardless of AZ distribution.

| LB Type | Default | Cost |
|---------|---------|------|
| **ALB** | Enabled | Free |
| **NLB** | Disabled | Charged |
| **GLB** | Disabled | Charged |

> Without cross-zone: If AZ-1 has 2 instances and AZ-2 has 8, each AZ gets 50% of traffic (unfair distribution)

---

### SSL/TLS & SNI

**SSL Termination:** LB decrypts HTTPS traffic, forwards HTTP to targets (offloads CPU from instances).

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SSL Certificate** | Loaded on LB via ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) |
| **SNI (Server Name Indication)** | Allows multiple SSL certs on one LB — client indicates hostname, LB selects correct cert |

**SNI Support:**

- ✅ ALB, NLB (multiple certs)
- ❌ CLB (one cert only)

> 💡 Use **ACM** for free, auto-renewing public certificates

---

### Connection Draining / Deregistration Delay

Time allowed for in-flight requests to complete when a target is deregistering or unhealthy.

| Setting | Default | Range |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Deregistration Delay** | 300s (5 min) | 0–3600s |

> 💡 Set to **0** for short-lived requests; increase for long uploads/connections

---

## Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

Automatically adjusts EC2 capacity to match demand. **ASG is free** — you pay only for instances.

### Capacity Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Minimum** | Never go below this |
| **Desired** | Target number of instances |
| **Maximum** | Never exceed this |

### Launch Template

Defines what to launch:

| Setting | Example |
|---------|---------|
| AMI | ami-0123456789 |
| Instance Type | t3.micro |
| IAM Role | MyEC2Role |
| Security Groups | sg-web |
| User Data | Bootstrap script |
| Key Pair | my-key |
| EBS Volumes | gp3, 20 GiB |

> 💡 CloudWatch alarms can trigger ASG scale-out/in based on metrics (CPU, RAM, custom)

### ASG Scaling Policies

| Policy | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Target Tracking** | Maintain a target metric value | Keep avg CPU at 40% |
| **Step Scaling** | Scale based on threshold ranges | CPU > 70% → +2, CPU < 30% → -1 |
| **Scheduled** | Scale at specific times | Add 3 instances every Friday 5PM |
| **Predictive** | ML-based forecasting | Pre-scale for predicted daily peaks |

- **Predictive Scaling** — ML analyzes historical load patterns, pre-provisions capacity ahead of predicted spikes. Great for recurring patterns (daily/weekly cycles).

### Scaling Metrics

| Metric | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **CPUUtilization** | Compute-bound apps |
| **RequestCountPerTarget** | Web servers behind ALB |
| **NetworkIn/Out** | Network-bound apps |
| **Custom (CloudWatch)** | App-specific (queue depth, etc.) |

---

### ASG Cooldown

Prevents rapid successive scaling actions. Default: **300 seconds**.

> 💡 Use shorter cooldown with faster-booting AMIs; longer for slow startup apps

---

### ASG Instance Refresh

Rolling update when you change Launch Template — replaces instances gradually.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Min Healthy %** | % of instances that must stay running (e.g., 90%) |
| **Warm-up** | Time before new instance counts as healthy |

> 💡 Enables zero-downtime deployments for Launch Template changes

## RDS (Relational Database Service)

Managed relational database — AWS handles patching, backups, scaling, HA, monitoring.

| Feature | Included |
|---------|----------|
| OS/DB patching | ✅ |
| Automated backups | ✅ |
| Multi-AZ failover | ✅ |
| Read replicas | ✅ (up to 15) |
| Encryption (at-rest & in-flight) | ✅ |
| Performance Insights | ✅ |

It supports MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, MariaDB, MS SQL Server, Aurora.

> ⚠️ **No SSH access** to the underlying instance

### Storage Auto Scaling

RDS automatically increases storage when running low. Set `MaxStorageThreshold` to cap it.

---

### Read Replicas vs Multi-AZ

| Feature | Read Replicas | Multi-AZ |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Read scaling | Disaster recovery |
| **Replication** | ASYNC (eventually consistent) | SYNC (immediate) |
| **Readable?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Standby only |
| **Cross-region?** | ✅ Yes (with cost) | ❌ Same region |
| **Failover** | Manual (promote to standalone) | Automatic |
| **Max count** | 15 | 1 standby |

**Cost:** Same-region RR replication = free. Cross-region = network charges.

**Multi-AZ setup:** Enable in console → snapshot taken → restored to standby AZ → sync begins. **Zero downtime.**

> 💡 Read replicas can also be Multi-AZ (common exam question)

---

### Amazon Aurora

AWS-built relational DB, compatible with **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Performance | 5x MySQL, 3x PostgreSQL |
| Storage | Auto-scales 10 GB → 128 TiB |
| Replicas | Up to 15 (faster replication than RDS) |
| Failover | < 30 seconds |
| Copies | 6 copies across 3 AZs |
| Cost | ~20% more than RDS |

**Self-healing:** Corrupted data blocks repaired via peer-to-peer replication.

### Aurora Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|--------|
| **Writer Endpoint** | Always points to current master (for writes) |
| **Reader Endpoint** | Load-balanced across all read replicas |
| **Custom Endpoint** | Route to specific subset of instances |

> 💡 Use Writer for writes, Reader for reads — endpoints auto-update on failover

---

### RDS & Aurora Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| **At-rest encryption** | KMS key at launch (encrypts master + replicas + snapshots) |
| **In-flight encryption** | TLS by default (use AWS TLS root certs) |
| **Authentication** | Username/password OR IAM DB authentication |
| **Network** | Security groups control access |

> To encrypt an unencrypted DB: snapshot → copy with encryption → restore

---

### RDS Proxy

Serverless connection pooler in front of RDS/Aurora.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Connection pooling** | Reduces DB load from many connections |
| **Failover** | Reduces failover time by 66% |
| **IAM auth** | Enforce IAM authentication |
| **VPC only** | Never publicly accessible |

> 💡 Great for Lambda → RDS (Lambda opens many short-lived connections)

---

---

## AWS ElastiCache

Managed in-memory caching — **Redis** or **Memcached**.

### Redis vs Memcached

| Feature | Redis | Memcached |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Multi-AZ** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Auto Failover** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Replication** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Persistence** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Backup & Restore** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Data structures** | Complex (lists, sets, sorted sets) | Simple key-value |
| **Sharding** | Cluster mode | Multi-node |

> 💡 **Exam tip:** Use **Redis** for HA, persistence, complex data. Use **Memcached** for simple caching, multi-threaded, horizontal scaling.

---

### Caching Considerations

| Question | Consider |
|----------|----------|
| **Safe to cache?** | What if stale data causes security/business issues? |
| **Effective?** | Best for slow-changing, frequently-read data |
| **Structure fit?** | Key-value lookups work best; complex joins may not |
| **TTL strategy?** | How long before data expires? |

---

### Caching Design Patterns

#### Lazy Loading (Cache-Aside)

```
App → Cache (miss?) → DB → Cache → App
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Only requested data cached | Cache miss = 3 network calls |
| Node failure not fatal | Stale data possible |
| Simple to implement | Must handle cache invalidation |

---

#### Write-Through

```
App → DB + Cache (write both)
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Cache always current | Write penalty (2 writes) |
| No stale data | Cache churn (data may never be read) |
| | Missing data until first write |

> 💡 Combine **Write-Through + Lazy Loading** for best results

---

#### TTL (Time-To-Live)

Set expiration on cached items. Balance between:
- **Short TTL** — Fresh data, more cache misses
- **Long TTL** — Fewer misses, risk of stale data

---

#### Write-Behind (Write-Back)

```
App → Cache → (async) → DB
```

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Fast writes (async to DB) | Data loss risk if cache fails |
| Reduces DB load | Complex to implement |
| Good for write-heavy workloads | Eventually consistent |

---

#### Read-Through

```
App → Cache (auto-fetches from DB on miss)
```

Cache sits between app and DB. On miss, cache itself fetches from DB and stores. Simpler app logic, but requires cache to understand DB.

---

### ElastiCache Use Cases

| Use Case | Pattern |
|----------|--------|
| Session storage | Redis with TTL |
| Database query caching | Lazy Loading + TTL |
| Real-time leaderboards | Redis Sorted Sets |
| Pub/Sub messaging | Redis Pub/Sub |
| Rate limiting | Redis counters with TTL |

---

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Object storage with **unlimited storage**, highly durable (99.999999999% — 11 9s).

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bucket** | Container for objects, globally unique name |
| **Object** | File + metadata, identified by key (full path) |
| **Key** | Full path including "folders" (e.g., `images/2024/photo.jpg`) |
| **Max object size** | 5 TB (use multipart upload for >100 MB, required >5 GB) |

### Storage Classes

| Class | Durability | Availability | Use Case |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **S3 Standard** | 11 9s | 99.99% | Frequently accessed data |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** | 11 9s | 99.9% | Unknown/changing access patterns |
| **S3 Standard-IA** | 11 9s | 99.9% | Infrequent access, rapid retrieval |

> 💡 Use **Lifecycle Policies** to automatically transition objects between classes

### S3 Security

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **User-based** | IAM policies |
| **Resource-based** | Bucket policies (JSON), Object ACLs, Bucket ACLs |
| **Encryption** | SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, client-side |

**Bucket Policy Structure:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
  }]
}
```

### S3 Encryption

| Type | Key Management | Use Case |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **SSE-S3** | AWS managed | Default encryption |
| **SSE-KMS** | KMS key | Audit trail, fine control |
| **SSE-C** | Customer-provided | Full key control |
| **Client-side** | Encrypt before upload | Maximum control |

> 💡 **SSE-KMS** has API call limits (quota). For high throughput, consider SSE-S3.

### S3 Versioning

- Enable at bucket level
- Protects against unintentional deletes (delete marker, not actual delete)
- Once enabled, can only be suspended (not disabled)
- `null` version ID for objects uploaded before versioning

### S3 Replication

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CRR** (Cross-Region) | Compliance, lower latency, replication across accounts |
| **SRR** (Same-Region) | Log aggregation, live replication between prod/test |

**Requirements:** Versioning enabled on both buckets, proper IAM permissions

> ⚠️ Only new objects replicated after enabling. Use **S3 Batch Replication** for existing objects.

### S3 Event Notifications

Trigger actions on bucket events (PUT, DELETE, etc.):

| Target | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **SNS** | Fan-out to multiple subscribers |
| **SQS** | Queue for processing |
| **Lambda** | Real-time processing |
| **EventBridge** | Advanced filtering, multiple destinations |

### S3 Performance

|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-part upload** | Parallelize uploads, recommended >100 MB |
| **Transfer Acceleration** | Use CloudFront edge locations for faster uploads |
| **Byte-range fetches** | Parallelize downloads by requesting byte ranges |
| **S3 Select / Glacier Select** | Retrieve subset of data using SQL |

**Baseline:** 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second **per prefix**.

### S3 Pre-signed URLs

Temporary access to private objects without changing bucket policy.

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://bucket/object --expires-in 3600
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Expires** | 1 second to 7 days (default: 1 hour) |
| **Permissions** | Inherits permissions of the user who generated it |

## AWS Lambda

Serverless compute — run code without managing servers.

### Key Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Memory** | 128 MB – 10,240 MB (10 GB) |
| **Timeout** | Max 15 minutes (900 seconds) |
| **Environment variables** | 4 KB total |
| **/tmp storage** | 512 MB – 10,240 MB |
| **Deployment package** | 50 MB zipped, 250 MB unzipped |
| **Concurrent executions** | 1,000 default (can increase) |
| **Layers** | Up to 5 per function |

> 💡 CPU scales proportionally with memory. More memory = more CPU = faster execution.

### Lambda Invocation Types

| Type | Behavior | Retries | Examples |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Synchronous** | Caller waits for response | None (caller handles) | API Gateway, SDK |
| **Asynchronous** | Fire and forget | 2 retries (3 total) | S3, SNS, EventBridge |
| **Event Source Mapping** | Lambda polls source | Depends on source | SQS, Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams |

### Asynchronous Invocation

```
Event → Lambda (internal queue) → [Retry 1] → [Retry 2] → DLQ/Destination
```

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Retries** | 2 retries with exponential backoff |
| **DLQ** | Dead Letter Queue (SQS or SNS) for failed events |
| **Destinations** | Route success/failure to SQS, SNS, Lambda, or EventBridge |

Lambda polls from:

| Source | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **SQS** | Batch processing, long polling |
| **SQS FIFO** | Lambda scales to # of message groups |
| **Kinesis/DynamoDB Streams** | Process in order per shard |

**Error Handling:**

- Entire batch fails if one record fails
- Options: discard, retry, split batch, send to DLQ/destination

### Lambda in VPC

By default, Lambda runs in AWS-managed VPC (has internet). To access private resources:

1. Configure VPC, subnets, security groups
2. Lambda creates ENIs in your subnets
3. Use NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnet

> ⚠️ Lambda in VPC has no internet unless you have NAT Gateway

### Lambda Concurrency

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unreserved** | Shared pool, up to account limit |
| **Reserved** | Guaranteed minimum for a function |
| **Provisioned** | Pre-initialized instances, no cold start |

**Cold Start:** First invocation initializes execution environment (can add seconds). Provisioned concurrency eliminates cold starts.

### Lambda Layers

Share code/dependencies across functions:

```
Function → Layer 1 (libs) → Layer 2 (common code)
```

- Up to 5 layers per function
- Total unzipped size < 250 MB
- Use for: common libraries, custom runtimes

### Lambda@Edge / CloudFront Functions

| Type | Location | Max Duration | Use Case |
|------|----------|--------------|----------|

### Integration Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Lambda Proxy** | Request passed as-is to Lambda, Lambda returns full response |
| **Lambda Custom** | Transform request/response with mapping templates |
| **HTTP Proxy** | Pass through to HTTP endpoint |
| **HTTP Custom** | Transform with mapping templates |
| **AWS Service** | Direct integration with AWS services |

> **429 Too Many Requests** when throttled. Client should retry with exponential backoff.

### Caching

- Cache responses at stage level
- TTL: 0-3600 seconds (default: 300)
- Cache size: 0.5 GB – 237 GB
- Cache key: method + resource path (can include headers/query params)

| **Table** | Collection of items |
| **Item** | Row (max 400 KB) |
| **Attribute** | Column (nested up to 32 levels) |
| **Primary Key** | Partition key (required) + optional sort key |

### Primary Key Options

| Type | Components | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Partition key** | Single attribute | Unique identifier |
| **Composite** | Partition + Sort key | One-to-many relationships |

> 💡 Choose partition key with high cardinality for even distribution

### Capacity Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Provisioned** | Set RCU/WCU, auto-scaling available | Predictable workloads |
| **On-Demand** | Pay per request | Unpredictable, new tables |

**Throughput units:**

| Unit | Capacity |
|------|----------|
| **1 RCU** | 1 strongly consistent read/sec (4 KB) OR 2 eventually consistent |
| **1 WCU** | 1 write/sec (1 KB) |

### Read Consistency

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Eventually consistent** | Default, might return stale data |
| **Strongly consistent** | Returns most recent data, uses 2x RCU |

### Secondary Indexes

| Type | Partition Key | Sort Key | When Created | Throughput |
|------|---------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **LSI** | Same as table | Different | Table creation only | Shares table's |
| **GSI** | Different | Different | Anytime | Separate (provision separately) |

> ⚠️ **GSI throttling** can throttle main table writes. Provision GSI capacity carefully.

### DynamoDB Streams

Ordered stream of item modifications (insert, update, delete).

| View Type | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| **KEYS_ONLY** | Just the key attributes |
| **NEW_IMAGE** | Item after modification |
| **OLD_IMAGE** | Item before modification |
| **NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES** | Both images |

**Use cases:** Trigger Lambda, replicate to other tables, analytics

### DynamoDB Operations

| Operation | Description | Cost |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **GetItem** | Single item by primary key | Uses RCU |
| **Query** | Items by partition key + optional sort key | Efficient, uses RCU |
| **Scan** | Entire table | Expensive, avoid in production |
| **BatchGetItem** | Up to 100 items | Parallel GetItem |
| **BatchWriteItem** | Up to 25 PutItem/DeleteItem | Parallel writes |

### Conditional Writes

```python
# Optimistic locking example
response = table.update_item(
    Key={'pk': 'item1'},
    UpdateExpression='SET #v = :newval, version = version + :inc',
    ConditionExpression='version = :expectedVersion',
    ExpressionAttributeValues={':expectedVersion': 1, ':newval': 'updated', ':inc': 1}
)
```

> 💡 Use for optimistic concurrency control — no locking overhead

| **Message Retention** | 4 days | Max: 14 days |
| **Max Message Size** | 256 KB | Use S3 for larger payloads |
| **Delay Queue** | 0 seconds | Delay before message is visible |
| **Long Polling** | Disabled | Wait for messages (reduces API calls) |

### Visibility Timeout

```
Receive → Message hidden → Process → Delete
                 ↓
         (If timeout expires before delete)
                 ↓
         Message reappears in queue
```

> 💡 If processing takes longer than visibility timeout, call `ChangeMessageVisibility`

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Messages that fail processing after `maxReceiveCount` go to DLQ.

| Setting | Description |

### Fan-Out Pattern

```
Producer → SNS Topic → SQS Queue 1 → Consumer 1
                    → SQS Queue 2 → Consumer 2
                    → Lambda → Process
```

> 💡 Decouple, parallel processing, different consumption rates

### Message Filtering

Filter messages per subscriber using **filter policies**:

```json
{
  "eventType": ["order_placed"],
  "store": [{"prefix": "us-"}]
}
```

### FIFO Topics

- Order guaranteed per message group
- Subscribers must be SQS FIFO queues
- Topic name must end with `.fifo`
