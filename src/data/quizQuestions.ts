  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log(typeof null)`,
    options: ['"null"', '"undefined"', '"object"', 'null'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'This is a historical bug in JavaScript. typeof null returns "object" even though null is a primitive. This was never fixed for backward compatibility.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log(typeof [])`,
    options: ['"array"', '"object"', '"Array"', '"undefined"'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Arrays are objects in JavaScript. typeof [] returns "object". Use Array.isArray([]) to check for arrays.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log([] + [])`,
    options: ['[]', '0', '""', 'undefined'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The + operator converts arrays to primitives via .toString(). Empty arrays become empty strings, so "" + "" equals "".'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log("A")\nsetTimeout(() => console.log("B"), 0)\nconsole.log("C")`,
    options: ['A B C', 'A C B', 'B A C', 'C A B'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'setTimeout callbacks go into the event loop and execute after the current call stack is empty, even with 0ms delay. So: A, C (sync), then B (async).'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0)\n}`,
    options: ['0 1 2', '3 3 3', '0 0 0', 'undefined undefined undefined'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'var is function-scoped, not block-scoped. When the callbacks run, the loop has finished and i equals 3. Use let instead to fix this.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const nums = [1, 2, 3]\nconst result = nums.map(n => { n * 2 })\nconsole.log(result)`,
    options: ['[2, 4, 6]', '[undefined, undefined, undefined]', '[]', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Arrow functions with {} need an explicit return statement. Without return, the function returns undefined. Use n => n * 2 or n => { return n * 2 }.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const a = { x: 1 }\nconst b = { x: 1 }\nconsole.log(a === b)`,
    options: ['true', 'false', 'undefined', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: '=== compares by reference for objects, not by value. a and b are different objects in memory, so they\'re not equal.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3)`,
    options: ['true', 'false', '0.3', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Floating point arithmetic in JavaScript (and most languages) has precision issues. 0.1 + 0.2 equals 0.30000000000000004, not exactly 0.3.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log([] == ![])`,
    options: ['true', 'false', 'Error', 'undefined'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: '![] is false (arrays are truthy, negated = false). [] == false coerces: [] → \'\' → 0, false → 0. 0 == 0 is true. Wild type coercion!'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log('5' - 3)`,
    options: ["'53'", '2', 'NaN', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The - operator only works with numbers, so '5' is coerced to 5. 5 - 3 = 2. But + would concatenate: '5' + 3 = '53'."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const arr = [1, 2, 3]\narr[10] = 11\nconsole.log(arr.length)`,
    options: ['4', '11', '10', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Setting arr[10] creates a sparse array with empty slots. The length becomes 11 (indices 0-10). Slots 3-9 are empty (not undefined).'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log(typeof NaN)`,
    options: ['"NaN"', '"undefined"', '"number"', '"object"'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "NaN (Not a Number) is paradoxically of type 'number'. Use Number.isNaN() to check for NaN, not typeof."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log(NaN === NaN)`,
    options: ['true', 'false', 'NaN', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself. Use Number.isNaN(x) instead of x === NaN.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `let x = 1\nlet y = x++\nconsole.log(x, y)`,
    options: ['1 1', '2 1', '2 2', '1 2'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'x++ returns the original value THEN increments. So y gets 1, then x becomes 2. Use ++x for pre-increment.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log("b" + "a" + +"a" + "a")`,
    options: ['"baaa"', '"baNaNa"', '"ba1a"', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: '+"a" tries to convert \'a\' to a number, resulting in NaN. So: \'b\' + \'a\' + NaN + \'a\' = \'baNaNa\'.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const nums = [10, 5, 40, 25, 100]\nconsole.log(nums.sort())`,

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "sort() converts elements to strings and sorts lexicographically. '10' < '5' because '1' < '5'. Always use sort((a, b) => a - b) for numbers."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const user = { name: "Ian" }\nuser.name = "John"\nconsole.log(user.name)`,
    options: ['"Ian"', '"John"', 'Error - const is immutable', 'undefined'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "const prevents reassignment, not mutation. You can change object properties. user = {} would throw an error, but user.name = 'John' is fine."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `console.log(x)\nlet x = 5`,
    options: ['undefined', '5', 'ReferenceError', 'null'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "let and const have a Temporal Dead Zone. They're hoisted but not initialized, so accessing before declaration throws ReferenceError."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `sayHi()\nvar sayHi = function() {\n  console.log("Hi")\n}`,
    options: ['"Hi"', 'undefined', 'TypeError', 'ReferenceError'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Function expressions are hoisted as undefined. Calling undefined() throws TypeError. Function declarations would work (fully hoisted).'
  },

    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const obj = { a: 1 }\nconsole.log(delete obj.a)\nconsole.log(obj.a)`,
    options: ['true, undefined', 'false, 1', 'true, 1', 'undefined, undefined'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'delete removes object properties and returns true. After deletion, accessing obj.a returns undefined.'

    question: "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
    options: [
      'A function that closes the browser',

    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its surrounding (lexical) scope, even after the outer function has returned.'
  },

    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `function outer() {\n  let count = 0\n  return function() {\n    count++\n    return count\n  }\n}\nconst fn = outer()\nconsole.log(fn(), fn(), fn())`,
    options: ['1 1 1', '1 2 3', '0 1 2', 'undefined'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'This is a closure. The inner function remembers the count variable from outer(). Each call increments and returns the same count.'
  },
  {
    question: "What runs first: microtasks or macrotasks?",
    options: ['Macrotasks', 'Microtasks', 'They run simultaneously', 'Random order'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Microtasks (Promises) run before macrotasks (setTimeout) after the current call stack is empty. This is why Promise.then() executes before setTimeout(..., 0).'
  },
  {
    question: "What does call() do?",
    options: [
      'Creates a new function',
      "Invokes a function with a specific 'this' value",
      'Delays function execution',
      'Copies a function'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "call() invokes a function immediately with a specified 'this' value and individual arguments. Similar to apply() which takes an array of arguments."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between == and ===?",
    options: [
      'No difference',
      '=== is faster',
      "== coerces types, === doesn't",
      '=== only works with numbers'
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: '== (loose equality) coerces types before comparing (5 == "5" is true). === (strict equality) compares both value AND type without coercion.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const user = { name: "Ian", skills: ["JS"] }\nconst copy = { ...user }\ncopy.skills.push("React")\nconsole.log(user.skills)`,
    options: ['["JS"]', '["JS", "React"]', 'undefined', 'Error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Spread creates a shallow copy. Nested arrays/objects are still references. Modifying copy.skills affects user.skills because they point to the same array.'
  },

    question: "What does Array.prototype.reduce() do?",
    options: [
      'Removes elements from an array',
      'Reduces array to a single value via accumulator',
      'Makes the array smaller',
      'Sorts the array'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'reduce() iterates through array elements, accumulating a single result. Takes (accumulator, currentValue) => newAccumulator and an initial value.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `[1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0)`,
    options: ['[1, 2, 3]', '6', '0', '123'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'reduce starts with 0 (initial value), then: 0+1=1, 1+2=3, 3+3=6. It accumulates all values into a single sum.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const arr = [1, 2, 3]\narr.forEach(n => n * 2)\nconsole.log(arr)`,
    options: ['[2, 4, 6]', '[1, 2, 3]', 'undefined', '[]'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "forEach doesn't modify the original array or return anything. It just executes a function for each element. Use map() to create a new transformed array."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between map() and forEach()?",
    options: [
      'No difference',
      'map returns a new array, forEach returns undefined',
      'forEach is faster',
      'map only works with numbers'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'map() returns a new array with transformed elements. forEach() returns undefined and is used for side effects only. Use map when you need the result.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does Promise.all() do?",
    options: [
      'Runs promises one by one',
      'Waits for all promises, fails if any fails',
      'Returns the first promise to resolve',
      'Ignores rejected promises'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Promise.all() waits for all promises to resolve and returns an array of results. If ANY promise rejects, the whole Promise.all() rejects immediately.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `Promise.resolve(1)\n  .then(x => x + 1)\n  .then(x => x * 2)\n  .then(console.log)`,
    options: ['1', '2', '4', 'undefined'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Promise chain: 1 → 1+1=2 → 2*2=4 → console.log(4). Each .then() transforms the value and passes it to the next.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does Object.keys() return?",
    code: `Object.keys({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })`,
    options: ['[1, 2, 3]', '["a", "b", "c"]', '{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }', '3'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Object.keys() returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names (keys), not values. Use Object.values() for values."
  },
  {
    question: "What is event delegation?",
    options: [
      'Passing events between components',
      'Attaching one handler to a parent instead of many to children',
      'Creating custom events',
      'Stopping event propagation'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Event delegation attaches a single event listener to a parent element to handle events from its children. Uses event bubbling. More efficient for many elements.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this code output?",
    code: `const fn = () => arguments\nfn(1, 2, 3)`,
    options: ['[1, 2, 3]', 'Arguments object', 'Error', 'undefined'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Arrow functions don't have their own 'arguments' object. They inherit from enclosing scope. Use rest parameters (...args) instead."

    options: [
      'No difference',
      'type supports unions, interface supports declaration merging',
      'interface is faster',
      'type can only be used for primitives'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Types support union types (A | B). Interfaces support declaration merging (multiple declarations combine). Both can describe object shapes.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does this do?",
    code: `type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error"`,
    options: [
      'Creates an array type',
      'Creates a union/literal type',
      'Creates an enum',
      'Creates a class'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'This creates a union of string literal types. A variable of type Status can only be one of these three specific strings.'

    options: [
      'Adds email to User',
      'Creates User type without the email property',
      'Makes email required',
      'Makes email optional'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Omit<Type, Keys> creates a new type by excluding specified properties. Omit<User, "email"> returns User without the email field.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'as const' do?",
    code: `const colors = ["red", "green"] as const`,
    options: [
      'Makes the array mutable',
      'Makes values deeply readonly with literal types',
      'Converts to a Set',
      "Nothing, it's invalid syntax"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "'as const' makes values deeply readonly and infers literal types. The array becomes readonly [\"red\", \"green\"] instead of string[]."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a type guard?",
    options: [
      'A function that protects types from being changed',
      'A function that narrows types at runtime',
      'A type that guards against null',
      'An interface for security'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Type guards are functions that narrow types at runtime. They use type predicates (value is Type) to help TypeScript understand the type after the check.'

      'Makes name and email optional',
      'Validates name and email'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Pick<Type, Keys> creates a new type by selecting only the specified properties. It's the opposite of Omit."
  },
  {
    question: "What type does this infer?",
    code: `const name = "Ian"  // type is:`,
    options: ['string', '"Ian"', 'any', 'unknown'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "With const, TypeScript infers the literal type \"Ian\", not string. This is because const values can't change, so TypeScript uses the narrowest type."
  },

    question: "What does Record<string, number> create?",
    options: [
      'An array of strings and numbers',

      'Directly mutating props (props are read-only)',
      'Missing return type',
      'Should use useState'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Props are immutable! Never mutate props directly. This can cause bugs and unexpected behavior. Instead, lift state up or use callbacks to modify data in the parent.'
  },
  {
    question: "When does a child component re-render?",
    options: [
      'Only when its own state changes',
      'Only when its props change',
      'When parent re-renders, props change, or its state changes',
      'Never automatically'
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "By default, when a parent re-renders, ALL its children re-render too (even if props didn't change). Use React.memo to prevent this."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does this cause unnecessary re-renders?",
    code: `<Child style={{ color: 'red' }} />`,
    options: [
      "It doesn't cause issues",
      'Inline object creates new reference every render',
      "Objects can't be passed as props",
      'style prop is reserved'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Inline objects create a new reference every render. Even if values are the same, React sees a 'new' prop, triggering child re-render. Use useMemo for stable references."
  },
  {
    question: "What is 'derived state'?",
    options: [
      'State from a database',
      "Values computed from existing state/props (shouldn't be stored in state)",
      'State shared between components',
      'Initial state values'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Derived state is a value that can be calculated from existing state or props. Don't store it in state — calculate it during render to avoid sync issues."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'UI = f(state)' mean in React?",
    options: [
      'UI is a function stored in state',
      'The UI is determined by (is a function of) the current state',
      'State should be a function',
      'Functions create UI elements'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "This is React's core philosophy: your UI is a pure function of your state. When state changes, React automatically re-renders to reflect the new state in the UI."
  },
  {
    question: "How does data flow in React?",
    options: [
      'Two-way binding (like Angular)',
      'Unidirectional: parent → child via props',
      'Child → parent via props',
      'Random, depends on component'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'React uses unidirectional data flow. Data flows DOWN via props (parent to child). Events/callbacks flow UP (child notifies parent). This makes data flow predictable.'
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when you call setState?",
    code: `setCount(5)\nconsole.log(count) // What's logged?`,
    options: [
      '5 (new value)',
      'The old value (state updates are async)',
      'undefined',
      'Error'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "State updates are asynchronous! The new value isn't available immediately after setState. Use useEffect to react to state changes, or functional updates for the next value."
  },
  {
    question: "Why use functional updates with setState?",
    code: `// Option A: setCount(count + 1)\n// Option B: setCount(c => c + 1)`,
    options: [
      'No difference',
      'Option B guarantees latest state value',
      'Option A is faster',
      'Option B is required'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Functional updates (c => c + 1) always use the latest state value. This avoids stale closure issues, especially when multiple updates happen or in event handlers.'
  },
  {
    question: "What's the correct way to update an object in state?",
    code: `const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Ian', age: 30 })`,
    options: [
      "user.name = 'New'; setUser(user)",
      "setUser({ ...user, name: 'New' })",
      "setUser(user.name = 'New')",
      "user = { name: 'New' }"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Never mutate state directly! Create a new object with spread: setUser({ ...user, name: 'New' }). React needs a new reference to detect changes and re-render."
  },
  {
    question: "What does useMemo do?",
    options: [
      'Memoizes a component',
      'Memoizes a computed value to avoid recalculation',
      'Stores data in memory forever',
      'Creates a ref'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'useMemo caches a computed value and only recalculates when dependencies change. Use for expensive calculations to avoid recomputing on every render.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does useCallback do?",
    options: [
      'Creates a callback function',
      'Memoizes a function to keep stable reference',
      'Delays function execution',
      'Calls a function automatically'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'useCallback returns a memoized function that only changes when dependencies change. Useful for passing stable callbacks to memoized children.'
  },
  {
    question: "When would you use useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect?",
    options: [
      'For async operations',
      'When you need to read/modify DOM before browser paints',
      'For simpler code',
      "Never, they're the same"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after DOM mutations but before paint. Use for DOM measurements or changes that must happen before the user sees the update.'
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of React Fragments?",
    code: `<>\n  <Child1 />\n  <Child2 />\n</>`,
    options: [
      'Adds extra DOM elements',
      'Groups elements without adding extra DOM nodes',
      'Makes components faster',
      'Enables lazy loading'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Fragments (<>...</> or <Fragment>) let you group children without adding extra DOM nodes. Useful when a component needs to return multiple elements.'
  },
  {
    question: "What's wrong with this code?",
    code: `function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  if (count > 5) {\n    const [extra] = useState('hi')\n  }\n  return <div>{count}</div>\n}`,
    options: [
      'Nothing wrong',
      'Hooks called conditionally (breaks rules of hooks)',
      'Missing key prop',
      'Wrong syntax'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Hooks must be called at the top level, in the same order every render. Conditional hooks break this rule and cause bugs. Move hooks outside conditions.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does useContext do?",
    options: [
      'Creates a new context',
      'Reads a value from a context without prop drilling',
      'Updates context automatically',
      'Replaces Redux'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "useContext reads current value from a Context. Avoids prop drilling - any component can access the context value without passing props through intermediate components."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",
    options: [
      'No difference',
      'Controlled uses React state, uncontrolled uses DOM refs',
      'Uncontrolled is faster',
      'Controlled requires Redux'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Controlled: React state is the source of truth (value + onChange). Uncontrolled: DOM manages state, you read values with refs. Prefer controlled for most cases.'
  },
  {
    question: "What does React.lazy do?",
    options: [
      'Makes components render slower',
      'Enables code-splitting by loading components lazily',
      'Delays state updates',
      'Creates lazy animations'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'React.lazy enables code-splitting. The component is loaded only when rendered. Wrap with Suspense to show fallback while loading. Great for large apps.'
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between useEffect with [] vs no array?",
    options: [
      'No difference',
      '[] runs once on mount, no array runs every render',
      'No array runs once, [] runs every render',
      'Both run on mount only'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'useEffect(() => {}, []) runs only on mount. useEffect(() => {}) with no dependency array runs after EVERY render. This is a common mistake!'
  },
  {
    question: "When does the useEffect cleanup function run?",
    options: [
      'Only when component mounts',
      'On unmount and before each effect re-run',
      'Only on unmount',
      'It never runs automatically'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Cleanup runs on unmount AND before the next effect runs (if dependencies changed). This prevents memory leaks and stale subscriptions.'
  },
  {
    question: "Why can't useEffect be async directly?",
    code: `useEffect(async () => {\n  await fetchData()\n}, [])`,
    options: [
      'It works fine',
      'async functions return Promises, useEffect expects void or cleanup',
      'async is not allowed in React',
      'It would be too slow'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'useEffect expects the callback to return nothing or a cleanup function. async returns a Promise. Define an async function inside useEffect instead.'
  },
  {
    question: "What causes stale closures in useEffect?",
    code: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setInterval(() => console.log(count), 1000)\n}, [])`,
    options: [
      'Using setInterval',
      'Empty dependency array captures initial count value forever',
      'Nothing is wrong',
      'useState is broken'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The empty [] means the effect never re-runs, so 'count' inside the callback is always 0 (the initial value). Add [count] to get current value."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle async errors in useEffect?",
    options: [
      'useEffect catches errors automatically',
      'Use try/catch inside an async function defined in useEffect',
      'Use a separate error hook',
      'Errors cannot occur in useEffect'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Define an async function inside useEffect, wrap logic in try/catch, and call that function. Store errors in state to display to users.'

    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'dependencies are needed at runtime (React, Express). devDependencies are only needed during development/build (TypeScript, Jest). Production installs skip devDependencies.'

      'Creating package.json'
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "npm ci does a clean install using package-lock.json exactly. It's faster and more reliable for CI/CD - deletes node_modules first and doesn't modify lockfile."
